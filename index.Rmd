I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to PISA evaluations through my work as a Research Economicst at [Center for Research in Health and Economics (CRES)](https://www.upf.edu/web/cres) at Pompeu Fabra University (UPF). 

I graduated from the [Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid](http://www.uam.es) in 2014. In 2015, I successfully completed the MS in Economics of Public Policy awarded by Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. 

<!-- In 2016 I began working toward my DrPH in biostatistics as a part-time student at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of etiologic heterogeneity in epidemiologic studies under the advisement of [Dr. Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) at Columbia University and [Dr. Colin Begg](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/colin-begg) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I expect to graduate by the end of 2018. -->

<!-- I am a well-known R enthusiast, including serving on the board and being an active member of [R Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/).
